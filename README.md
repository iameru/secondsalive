You can enter your birthday, exact to Hour and Minute.
The Tool displays how old you are in seconds ðŸ¥³
Also displays cool dates with a counter to them like when do/did you hit:

- 1.000.000 seconds?
- 1.000.000.000 seconds?? _or even_
- 1.234.567.890 seconds???!

## lol..

This is just a small little playground for a small little website out of a joke.
In case you find some huge flaw, for example that javascript **doesn't handle leapseconds well enough** or that I should use this or that library.. fine. Write an issue but be warned that I might not care that much. Suggestions still welcome though!
